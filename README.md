# Ankikorean

A simple website using Elixir Phoenix and VueJS for making flash cards easily. A small project for me to learn more about Elixir and Phoenix, whilst also making something that is useful. 

Interesting things:
- Phoenix is fast, 200Î¼s in prod for basic calls (some use curl, so they take a while)
- No database is used, only caching via ETS
